# Taskify

## Overview

Taskify is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users track their tasks with other BCIT students. The app displays a curated list of hike trails, each with details such as name, location, difficulty, and an image. Users can browse the list and mark their favorite trails for easy access later.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.
